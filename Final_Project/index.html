    <p>
        Recently, Taiwan experienced a magnitude 7.4 earthquake, and another magnitude 6.1 earthquake occurred at 3:13 a.m. on April 27th. 
        With an increase in seismic activity, concerns about the region’s vulnerability to earthquakes and the potential impact on its population, infrastructure, and economy are rising. 
        Situated in an active seismic zone, earthquake analysis is crucial for assessing risks and disaster management. This project aims to conduct an analysis of earthquake activity in Taiwan, including its frequency and magnitude distribution, with the goal of
        enhancing seismic resilience and preparedness measures.
    </p>

    <p>
        The image shows a map of Taiwan, an island located in East Asia. 
        The map not only showcases the geographical features of Taiwan but also shows its administrative divisions, including counties and cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taiwan is administratively divided into 13 counties, 3 county-controlled cities, and 6 special municipalities. 
      The counties include areas like Hsinchu County, Miaoli County and Changhua County, among others. 
      The three cities are Hsinchu City, Keelung City, and Chiayi City. 
      Special municipalities are Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Tainan City, and Kaohsiung City.
      These administrative divisions form the foundation of Taiwan's local governance and organization.

<div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="dataset">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16  w3-text-black">Dataset</h3>
    
    <p>
        The dataset used in this analysis is obtained from the <a href="https://gdms.cwa.gov.tw/index.php">Taiwan Central Weather Administration’s Taiwan Geophysical Database Management System</a>,
        covering earthquake records from Jan 1, 1973, to March 21, 2024 with magnitude greater than 4.0. The dataset includes fifteen attributes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> Year-Month-Day</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> hour:minute:sec.ss</li>
        <li><strong>Latitude:</strong> Latitude (North)</li>
        <li><strong>Longitude:</strong> Longitude (East)</li>
        <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Focal Depth (km)</li>
        <li><strong>ML:</strong> Earthquake magnitude</li>
        <li><strong>NSTN:</strong> Station number</li>
        <li><strong>DMIN:</strong> Epicentral distance to the nearest station</li>
        <li><strong>GAP:</strong> Largest azimuthal separation in degrees between stations</li>
        <li><strong>TRMS:</strong> Root-mean-square error of the time residuals</li>
        <li><strong>ERH:</strong> Standard error of the epicenter in km</li>
        <li><strong>ERZ:</strong> Standard error of the depth in km</li>
        <li><strong>FIXED:</strong> Focal depth control (F: free run, X: fixed depth)</li>
        <li><strong>NPH:</strong> Number of phases picked</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Solution quality of the hypocenter based on station distribution and RMS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The quality attribute is classified into four ranks (A, B, C, D) based on the number of stations, gap, and minimal epicentral distance of stations. See the table below for details:
    </p>
    <table class="w3-table w3-bordered" style="margin: auto;">
        <tr>

            <th>Minimal Epicentral Distance of Station</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>

    <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16  w3-text-black">Limitation</h4>
    <p>
        The limitation is that this dataset only
        has attributes of longitude and latitude and thus is
        difficult in geospatial analysis. Without city or
        county information, it's challenging to perform
        geospatial analysis to identify regions with higher
        seismic activity. Analyzing earthquakes based solely
        on latitude and longitude coordinates may not provide
        sufficient details to pinpoint specific areas prone to
        frequent earthquakes.

<div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="task">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16  w3-text-black">Tasks</h3>
    The following are the five tasks I want to explore with
    the earthquake dataset:
    <ol>
      <li>
        What time in the day does the earthquake occur most
        frequently?
      </li>
      <li>
        In which month did the earthquake that had the
        highest magnitude occur?
      </li>
      <li>
        Where do earthquakes of higher magnitude or depth
        tend to occur more frequently? In which city or
        county in Taiwan? In which region of Taiwan?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there any correlation between the magnitude of
        earthquakes and their focal depth?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes
        vary over time?
      </li>
    </ol>

        This ridgeline plot visualizes the distribution of
        earthquake magnitudes for each month using Kernel
        Density Estimation plots. It helps to find the
        month with the highest magnitude earthquake and
        compare the magnitude distribution density across
        different months, with the y-axis representing the
        density of earthquake distribution for magnitudes.

      Task 3 & 4: Spatial Distribution of Earthquakes by
      Magnitude & Correlation between Earthquake Magnitude
      and Depth
    </h3>

    <p>
        Task 3 & 4 provide insights into the spatial distribution of earthquakes by magnitude and the correlation between earthquake magnitude and depth. 
        On the left, you'll find interactive controls to select a specific year, options to color the dots in different ways, as well as the attributes for the x and y axes of the scatterplot. 
        These controls allow you to customize the visualization according to your preferences and your interest to explore the earthquake data. 
        The map visualization on the left displays the spatial distribution of earthquakes across Taiwan, providing a geographical perspective of seismic activity. 
        It provides insights into how earthquakes of different magnitudes are distributed across various regions of the country.
        On the right, the scatterplot reveals the relationship between earthquake magnitude, depth, quality, and months across a year, allowing for deeper analysis and understanding of seismic patterns.
        Mouse over the dots in the either the map or the scatterplot will provide detailed information about that specific earthquake. 
        In addition, mouse over administratice divisions on the map will show the name of the county or city.
