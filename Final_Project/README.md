Welcome to my project. The dataset I picked is the
earthquake data in Taiwan.

Tasks I want to explore are:

- Where do earthquakes of higher magnitude or depth tend to
  occur more frequently? In which city or county in Taiwan?
  In which region of Taiwan?
- Is there any correlation between the magnitude of
  earthquakes and their focal depth?
- How do the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes vary
  over time?

The website contains visualizations for other tasks. Please
take a look at Tasks 3, 4 and 5. 
You could click on the buttons on the top-right corner to
jump to a specific section that you are interesd in or you can just scroll down 
the page and view sections one by one. Clicking on the button on the top-left corner will refirect back to the home page.

You could interact with the map and scatterplot by choosing
a specific year, the x attribute, and y attribute of the
scatterplot and mouse over the dots in the plot. 
Your could also zoom in/out the map.
